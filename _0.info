Flow R scripts for flow analysis.
-Each Rmd is setup to run on an empty environemnt with eveerything needed loaded within that Rmd.

theme_Publication.R --> theme for graphs

*FOLDERS:* 
  00_raw_data - raw unmanipulated data
  01_tidy_data - manipulated/transformed/subsetted data or new dataframes generated for downstream analysis
  02_tables - tabled results from analyses preformed 
  03_ plots - visuals generated

*Rmd Files:*
  _1.data_prep.Rmd
    This scrift only needs to be ran ONCE.
      - Script preps and inspects data for use in downstream analysis. It will save a new dataframe in tidy data folder to be used for analysis. 
      
      STEP1: Import data and Prep Data
      STEP2: Visually Inspect Data 
      STEP3: Prep Tools for Downstream Analysis
      
  _2.data_plots.Rmd
  
      STEP1: Load Data 
      STEP2: Generate Summary Statistics 
        - Generate and save summary statistics for use in generating bargraphs of flow data.  
      STEP3: Generate First Pass Bar Graphs of All Data
        - Generate a plots: Run theme_publication in theme_Publication.R 
            (1) main folder: combined grid of bargraphs for all flow measurments and treatment arms 
            (2) faceted:: (a) facet by treatment to compare T21vD21 (b) facet by cell to compare treatment 
            (3) bytreatment: individual graphs of each treatment for each flow measure visualizing cell type comparisions
            (4) bycell: individual graphs of each cell type for each flow measure visualizing treatment comparisions
            (5) byday: individual plots for each day and treatment combination of all measurements and cell types 
            (6) main folder: combined graph of cell types and multiple treatments for each measurment 
      
  _3.stats_analysis_vsCTRL.Rmd
  
      STEP1: Load Libraries and Data 
      STEP2: Assumptions for Data in Comparison 
        - Script will run test of equal variance and normality assumptions on data. For most accurate results you 
        should only include data that will be directly compared for these tests, thus this script runs 
        assumptions for each flow measurement at a given day (1) For each treatment, T21 vs D21  and (2) For each 
        cell type, treatment vs control. As these are the comparision I wish to make.
      
      STEP3: 
      - Similarly the script will run four common statistic tests 
            (1) Kruskal Wallis Multiple Comparision Non Parametric Test 
            (2) Wilcoxon signed-rank Test 
            (3) Welch's Paired Non Parametric T Test 
            (4) Paired T Test. 
        Results for assumptions and statistic tests are store in two  dataframe (a) cell comparision and (b) treatment comparision 

      notes: The control group is manually defined in the code as "CTRL" if you want to change the control group
         you can do so by just changing that line of code. The code is set up to save the file with the 
         treatment you set as the control. For example if you set control = CTRL the file will save as 
         TreatmentvsCTRL. If you set control = RA then file will say TreatmentvsRA. I would recommend also 
         editing the folder code to create a folder to match your new control arm. or to save differently 
      
    _4.count.Rmd
        - script for analyzing cell count data. Generates line and best fit graphs. Run stats comparing to 
          CTRL treatment and D21 vs T21 
          

STATISTICS GUIDE 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
#If variance and normality pass: parametric test
  1. ANOVA - multiple comparison
     a.tukeys.temp.Rmd -- all comparisons 
     b.contrast.comp.temp.rmd -- select comparison 
  2. T-test paired (2 groups)

#If variance passed and normality failed: 
  1. Kruskal Wallis Test (ANOVA Alt) -- ANOva alt, multiple comparisons (not paired)
      a. dunns as follow up if more thancomparisons 
  2. Mann Whitney U test/Wilcoxon rank-sum tests - t-test (not paired) 
  3. Wilcoxon signed-rank test - t-test paired alt --- *** needs higher samples size  
  
#If varaiance and normality failed: 
  a. Welch's -- non normal var and dist -- (2 groups)

Stat notes:
Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test automatically provides adjusted p-values to account for multiple comparisons. These p-values, often referred to as "corrected" or "adjusted," are included in the TukeyHSD() output under the p adj column.

How Tukey's HSD Adjusts P-Values
Tukey's method controls the family-wise error rate (FWER), ensuring that the probability of making at least one Type I error across all pairwise comparisons is below your significance level (commonly 0.05).
This adjustment is necessary when performing multiple comparisons because it reduces the likelihood of false positives.
